# AS-GovernmentAgency
About this project

A government agency operates legacy systems for program benefits, public records,
constituent engagement, and case management systems built up over decades. Data is
fragmented across systems, limiting insights and overview of operations. Changing systems
requires complex coordination across teams.
The siloed systems make it extremely difficult for the agency to gain a holistic view of
constituent needs and interactions. For example, citizen profileslack integrated case history
across benefits, taxes, licenses, and services. This restricts the agency's ability to proactively
identify issues and streamline engagements. The agency needs shared data access across
business functions to better understand and serve constituents.
The solution would identify microservices aligned to capabilities like benefits management
and constituent profiles. These would provide APIs for relevant data secured by a gateway.
A cloud data lake consolidates this data for analytics. This approach incrementally
decomposes monoliths over time into focused, decoupled services that deliver unified data
access through managed APIs. There are some specifications:
▪ Develop microservices for benefits management, constituent profiles, records access.
▪ Expose relevant program data via APIs controlled through a gateway.
▪ Ingest API data into a cloud data lake.
▪ Provide analytics across consolidated data to optimize operations.
